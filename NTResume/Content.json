          "paragraph": "I became particularly interested in mobile and web development as it joined to unique aspects: designing UI/UX and programming the functionality to complement it. This is because I enjoy someone picking up something I've made in amazement. Now I am starting to learn more about servers, databases and security in a never ending pursuit of my imagination."
